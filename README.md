# Welcome to the Treasury Digital Design System (TDDS)

[TDDS](https://treasury.invisionapp.com/dsm/u-s-department-of-the-treasury/tdds) is the United States Department of the Treasury's open-source design system. It contains user experience (UX) guidance, tools, reusable, accessible components, and open-source code. The following file types are available for your use and can be found in their corresponding folders:



## Components
- [Sketch](http://sketch.com) Design Kit ([download](https://github.com/US-Department-of-the-Treasury/tdds/raw/master/Components/tdds-components.sketch))
- [Figma](http://figma.com) Design Kit ([download](https://github.com/US-Department-of-the-Treasury/tdds/blob/master/Components/Treasury%20Digital%20Design%20System%20(TDDS).fig))
- [Adobe XD](https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps/all/desktop) Design Kit ([download](https://github.com/US-Department-of-the-Treasury/tdds/blob/master/Components/tdds-components.xd))

## Fonts
- Public Sans
- Merriweather

## Colors
- Sketch color palette

## Installing the color palettes

1.  Add the [Sketch Palette](https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes) plugin.
2.  From the color picker, select Load Palette... from either the Global Colors or the Document Colors menu. **Please note** that doing this will replace whatever colors are currently in the selected section. If you’re concerned about losing your Global Colors, consider adding our palette to only your Document Colors menu.
3. Navigate to WDS.sketchpalette to install the palette.

### Sketch & Figma Notes

Some single-function components, such as buttons, have been turned into symbols with layer styles for easy access from the symbol menu. Before you alter anything (except text), detach the instance of the symbol so that you don’t change every instance. We’ve left more complex components, such as footers, as groups.

Where appropriate, we’ve created type styles and layer styles to make these components easier to adapt.

Style and symbol names are a compromise between Treasury Digital Design System naming conventions, U.S. Web Design System CSS naming conventions (which allow us to transition Sketch files more easily into development) and names that make sense in the context of screen design. 

Please note that our team primarily uses Sketch. We've translated TDDS into Adobe XD, but are not actively maintaining the file as of April 2023.
